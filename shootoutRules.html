    <p>The Prize consists of the following package: Each Potential Finalist and the guest of their choosing will be provided airfare from the nearest international airport to the Potential Finalist’s home address to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport on May 24, 2025. The guest of the Potential Finalist must be twenty-one (21) years of age or older as of March 5, 2025. Each Potential Finalist and guest will be provided transportation from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to the hotel of Sponsor’s choosing.

The Potential Finalist and their guest will be invited to a dinner hosted by Sponsor on May 23, 2025. On May 24, 2025, the Potential Finalist will be invited to participate in a hole-in-one golf shootout (“Golf Shootout”). The Potential Finalist’s guest will not be able to participate in the Golf Shootout. All other expenses will be the responsibility of the Potential Finalist and/or its guest.</p>
    <p>The Potential Finalist and guest will be transported from the hotel to the place of the Golf Shootout on May 24, 2025. Spectators will be invited to watch the Golf Shootout. The rules of the Golf Shootout will be as follows:</p>
    <ol>

The Prize will be paid by Obsidian Specialty Insurance (“Insurer”) Company pursuant to its “Prize Award Installment Endorsement” which can be viewed here. Any action taken by the Potential Finalist that voids payment by Insurer will void Sponsor’s liability and/or obligation to the Potential Finalist in the event of a hole-in-one shot made. More than one Potential Finalist may win the Maximum Prize in the event of multiple hole-in-one shots made.</p>
    <p>If there are no hole-in-one shots made by the Potential Finalists, the finalist with the shot that is closest to the pin, measured by distance from the final resting place of the Potential Finalist’s ball to the center of the hole, will win a prize of Five Thousand and 00/100 US Dollars ($5,000.00) (“Consolation Prize”). If more than one Finalist’s shots are an equal distance from the center of the hole, the winner of the Consolation Prize will be selected via flipping a coin.</p>

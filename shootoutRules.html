    <p>If there are no hole-in-one shots made by the Potential Finalists, the finalist with the shot that is closest to the pin, measured by distance from the final resting place of the Potential Finalist’s ball to the center of the hole, will win a prize of Five Thousand and 00/100 US Dollars ($5,000.00) (“Consolation Prize”). If more than one Finalist’s shots are an equal distance from the center of the hole, the winner of the Consolation Prize will be selected via flipping a coin.</p>
